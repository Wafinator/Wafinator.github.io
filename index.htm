         Hello, my name is Wafi Hassan. I am a 20-year-old CS major who started this website as a project for my COMP2057 class 2 years ago and am currently renovating the website to give it a more updated and better look! I hope you enjoy your stay here. Some things about me: I was born on October 27th, 2003 in Windsor,Ontario<br>
         to a family of 5. I have a brother and a sister alongside my two parents. I enjoy playing video games, primarily League of Legends and Valorant where I am Diamond and Gold rank in both games. <br>Some people may also know me 
         to be a bit of a computer nerd.
      </p>

         I have had a passion for cars since my early childhood although that passion has been dying out as the years go by. I used to have a large toy car collection including Hot Wheels and other cars that I bought or got gifted to me <br>
         until recently, I had to throw out many of the ones I didn't want anymore. I remember vividly when I was a kid I used to pick up the driver's manual book at Walmart and would read it while my parents would shop. 
      </p>

         I also love playing soccer. I enjoy playing defence and occasionally like playing midfield to set up plays for the team. During the summer, me and my friends would go to the park every day to play pick-up soccer.<br>
         Not only that, but I also really enjoyed watching soccer too! I supported Germany during the 2014 World Cup which they ended up winning. I am also a big fan of Arsenal FC in the English Premier League.
