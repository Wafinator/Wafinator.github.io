         Hello, my name is Wafi Hassan. I am an 18 year old cs major creating a website as a project for my COMP2057 class! I hope you enjoy your stay here. Some things about me: I was born on October 27th, 2003 in Windsor,Ontario<br>
         to a family of 5. I have a brother and a sister along side my two parents. I enjoy playing video games, primarily League of Legends and Valorant where I am Platinum and Gold rank in both games. <br>Some people may also know me 
         to be a bit of a nerd.
      </p>

         I have a passion for cars since my early childhood although that passion has been dying out as the years go by. I use to have a large toy car collection including hot wheels and other cars that I bought or got gifted to me <br>
         until recently when I had to throw out a lot of the ones that I didnt want anymore. I remember vividly when I was a kid I use to pick up the driver's manual book at Walmart and would read it while my parents would shop. 
      </p>

         I also love playing soccer. I enjoy playing defense and occasionaly like playing midfield to setup plays for the team. During the summer me and my friends would go to the park everyday to play pick-up soccer.<br>
         Not only that, but I also really enjoyed watching soccer too! I supported Germany during the 2014 World Cup which they ended up winning. I am also a big fan of Arsenal FC in the English Premier League.
